# -Plant-Species-Image-Classification-

## A. Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify different plant species based on image data. The model was trained using 50 epochs, a batch size of 16, and a learning rate of 0.001 to achieve stable and efficient learning. Performance was evaluated using accuracy per plant species, allowing detailed analysis of how well the model recognizes each type of plant. The results show varying accuracy levels across 20 plant species, highlighting both strong classifications and areas that need improvement.

## B. Plant Species Section
Common Name:Juneberry 
Scientific Name: Amelanchier

Juneberry (Amelanchier) is a small deciduous shrub or tree known for its sweet, edible berries that ripen in early summer. The berries are often dark purple and resemble blueberries, making them popular for jams, pies, and fresh eating. Juneberries also have attractive white flowers in spring and vibrant fall foliage, making them both a food source and an ornamental plant.
